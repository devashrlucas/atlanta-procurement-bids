# Atlanta Procurement Bids

This project can be used as a quicker way to view all of the services solicitations available on the Department of Procurement’s website for the City of Atlanta. One solicitation is shown per page. Refreshing the page will show the next solicitation from the “Choose a solicitation” dropdown menu.

As of right now, there is no way to go back and view previously seen solications. If you see a solication that you would like to look at later, please be sure to save the url for that solication found above the title of the solicitation. Any required bid documents will need to be downloaded from the original url as well.
